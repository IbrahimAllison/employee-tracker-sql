# employee-tracker-sql

## Description

The project is about creating a Content Management System that "allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases". A user can pull up an employee's name, title, department, salary, and the employee's manager.

## Motivation for the Project

I am motivated to learn how to create a database using MySQL. I have worked with seed data as a Quality Assurance Analyst using GUI (Graphical User Interface). I was curious to know how I can create, modify, update, and manage a database using a Command Line Interface instead of using a GUI.


## What Problem does it solve?

It helps a business owner to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, salaries, and employees record so that they may organize and plan their business effectively and efficiently. 

## Usage/Installation

Here is an high level steps for creating and executing the employee tracker application.

Step 1:  Create the necessary folders and files. For this application, I created a db folder (with schema.sql and seeds.sql files embedded in the folder), gitignore, and server.js (all the javascript codes needed for the application will be created here).

Step 2: run the command "npm init". This will automatically create or initialize a package.json file.

Step 3: run the command "npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install the inquire package.

Step 4: run the command "npm i mysql2 to install MySQL2 database.

Step 5: run npm i console.table

Step 6: add cfonts dependency to the package.json file.

Step 7: invoke the application by running node server.js
